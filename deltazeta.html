         <td> This was me and my best friends first football game together. Cara and I met on bid day. We instantly became best friends and haven't seperated since. It was such an amazing feeling knowing that I found the right place for me and I that have my new college best friend. We share so many similarities and always have a blast together, I wouldn't want any other best friend! She is amazaing I love her! 
        </td>
        <td> This was our first trip together as a sorority! Frat beach was the weekend of the Georgia Florida football game. Lots and lots of sororities and fraternities travel together to throw a huge party on the beach. It is so much fun seeing everyone in the same place and its always a joy to watch the dawgs win! Go Dawgs!!!
        </td>
        <td>This was a trip to New Orleans that a few of my friends and I took! We were able to stay in New Orleans for the weekend and visit Baton Rouge for the LSU game. Sadly the dawgs did not show through for us during this game, but we still love them. Seeing another college town and traveling with my closest friends was so much fun! I wouldn't take any experience with them back, every moment is a new opportunity to create a memory! </td>
