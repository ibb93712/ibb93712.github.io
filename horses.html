    <h1> <u> Here is what takes up majority of my life! </h1> </u>
    <p> I was born into a fmaily of horse people, both sides of my family going generations back owning horses. We joke about how I was taken to the barn before home after I was born. 19 years later and I still can not shake the obession. I spend hours on end every day at the barn riding and taking care of my horses, and weekends traveling the country for horse shows. It is a major commitment but I wouldn't give it up for the world.  </p>

            <td1>  This is a video from over the summer with my jumper horse Chaz. Chaz is a 16 imported warmblood and he is the most incredible animal I have ever ridden. He is an amazing blessing and we will be competing for several different national championships throughout the next few months! </td1> </tr>
